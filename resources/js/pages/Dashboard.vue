            <p class="text-justify text-lg xl:text-left">
                A resume should be tailored for each role to significantly increase the chances of catching the attention of hiring managers and
                applicant tracking systems (ATS). Every job posting highlights a unique combination of skills, qualifications, and experiences that
                the employer is seeking. When you customize your resume to align closely with those specific requirements, you demonstrate that you’ve
                taken the time to understand the role and that you’re a strong, relevant candidate.

                <li>
                    <strong>Highlight the most relevant experience:</strong> Align your accomplishments and responsibilities with the job description
                    to show your suitability for the role.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stand out from generic applications:</strong> Customized resumes show initiative and attention to detail, making you more
                    memorable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improve keyword match for ATS:</strong> Tailoring increases your chances of passing software that screens for job-specific
                    keywords.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Showcase your value:</strong> Emphasize how your past experiences contribute directly to the success of the company in
                    this specific role.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-justify text-lg xl:text-left">
                In short, tailoring your resume is a strategic move that not only increases your chances of getting an interview but also positions
                you as the best possible fit for the job.
